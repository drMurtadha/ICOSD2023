# Extended Abstract: Relationship between Undergraduate Student Academic Performance and Mental Health

## Introduction
The purpose of this extended abstract is to explore the relationship between undergraduate student academic performance and mental health, specifically focusing on depression, anxiety, and stress levels. The study aims to investigate how these psychological factors may impact students' academic achievements and shed light on potential interventions to support their well-being.

## Methodology
1. **Participant Selection**: A total of 57 undergraduate students from a residential university hostel were selected as respondents for this study.
2. **Survey Instrument**: The survey questionnaire used in this research was developed by Lovibond and Lovibond (1995) and is widely recognized for assessing depression, anxiety, and stress levels. The questionnaire consists of several validated scales and items that measure these constructs.
3. **Data Collection**: The survey was distributed among the identified respondents, who voluntarily participated in the study. Their responses were collected anonymously to ensure confidentiality and minimize bias.
4. **Data Analysis**: The collected data were analyzed using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and regression analysis to examine the relationship between academic performance and mental health indicators.

## Results
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: The demographic characteristics of the participants were analyzed, including age, gender, academic year, and major. Descriptive statistics provided an overview of the sample population.
2. **Mental Health Scores**: The scores for depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated based on the survey responses. The distribution and average scores for each mental health indicator were reported.
3. **Academic Performance Measures**: Academic performance measures, such as grade point average (GPA) and the number of courses failed or repeated, were considered to assess students' achievements.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation coefficients were computed to examine the relationships between academic performance measures and mental health scores. The strength and direction of these associations were reported.
5. **Regression Analysis**: Regression models were employed to explore the predictive power of mental health indicators on academic performance. Multiple regression analysis was conducted, controlling for demographic variables.

## Discussion
1. **Interpretation of Findings**: The results of the study indicated the nature and strength of the relationship between mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress) and academic performance among undergraduate students.
2. **Impact on Academic Performance**: The discussion will explore how mental health factors may affect various aspects of academic performance, including GPA, course completion, and overall achievement.
3. **Implications and Recommendations**: Based on the study findings, practical implications and recommendations for educational institutions and student support services will be provided. These may include mental health awareness campaigns, counseling services, and academic accommodations.
4. **Limitations**: The limitations of the study, such as the small sample size and potential biases, will be acknowledged to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research's scope and generalizability.
5. **Future Research**: Suggestions for future research directions, such as longitudinal studies and interventions to mitigate mental health issues, will be outlined to encourage further investigation in this area.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this extended abstract summarizes the study's objectives, methodology, results, and implications. The research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between undergraduate student academic performance and mental health, providing valuable insights for academic institutions and student support services to foster student well-being and success.
